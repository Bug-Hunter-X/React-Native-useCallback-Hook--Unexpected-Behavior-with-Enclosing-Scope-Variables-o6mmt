The solution is to include `count` in the dependency array of `useCallback`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('count:', count); // Now logs the updated count
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); // Include 'count' in the dependency array

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

By adding `count` to the dependency array, the `increment` callback is now recreated whenever `count` changes, ensuring that it always uses the current value of `count`.  This resolves the unexpected behavior.
