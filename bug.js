This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React with a function that accesses a variable from its enclosing scope.  If the variable changes, the callback function isn't automatically updated, leading to unexpected behavior.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('count:', count); // This will always log the initial count
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array is the problem

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `increment` callback is memoized with an empty dependency array, meaning it's only recreated when the component mounts.  Subsequent changes to `count` won't trigger a re-creation, leading to `count` always logging its initial value.
